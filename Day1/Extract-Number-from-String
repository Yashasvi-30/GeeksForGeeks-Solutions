## Explanation

The input is a string that may contain words and numbers. 
The goal is to divide the sentence into tokens, where each token represents a word or number. 
The tokens are created by separating each word or number with a space. 

After creating the tokens in a string array, each token is checked to determine if it contains a number. 
If a number is found, it is compared with a pre-declared variable that is initially set to -1. 
If the number is valid according to the given conditions (in this case, it should not contain the digit 9),
 and if the number is greater than the value stored in the variable, then the number is stored in the variable.




```java
String inputString = "The input is a string that may contain words and numbers.";
String[] tokens = inputString.split(" ");
```

After executing this code, the `tokens` array will contain the tokens, where each token represents a word or number from the input string.

You can then iterate over the `tokens` array and perform further operations on each token, such as checking if it contains a number or comparing it with a variable.

or maybe use text format 


The input is a string that may contain words and numbers. 
The goal is to divide the sentence into tokens, where each token represents a word or number. 
The tokens are created by splitting the input string using the regular expression `\\s+`, which matches one or more whitespace characters. 
After splitting, the tokens are stored in a string array. 
You can then iterate over the `tokens` array and perform further operations on each token, such as checking if it contains a number or comparing it with a variable.

```java
String inputString = "The input is a string that may contain words and numbers.";
String[] tokens = inputString.split("\\s+");
```

After executing this code, the `tokens` array will contain the tokens, where each token represents a word or number from the input string.
